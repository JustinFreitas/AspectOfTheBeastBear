Aspect Of The Beast: Bear v1.2, by Justin Freitas

ReadMe and Usage Notes

The purpose of this Fantasy Grounds 5e extension is to apply an additional 2x multiplier to encumbrance limits to barbarians of level 6 or higher that have the Aspect of the Beast: Bear listed in their features.  The 'Bear' designation can be separated from the main feature with a dash or colon (i.e. - or :).  Any amount of white space is also fine as it's matched via a flexible regular expression.  Note, that if the client is FGU of 4.1.14 or greater, this functionality is built in and works off of 'Aspect of the Bear' by default, so the extension will be smart and not double up the bonus a second time if both are found.

Future Enhancements:
- Have the barbarian class and level filtering be an option instead of always enabled, defaulting to enabled.

Changelist:
- v1.0 - Initial version.
- v1.1 - Improvements to conform to FGU and upcoming standards. Improvements in code structure.  Matching/regex improvements for flexibility and reliability.  Function renaming for clarity.
- v1.2 - Fixed the extension to work with the FGU 4.1.14+ Aspect of the Bear functionality and not double the bonus a second time.
