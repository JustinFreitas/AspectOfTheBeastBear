ReadMe and Usage Notes

The purpose of this Fantasy Grounds 5e extension is to apply an additional 2x multiplier to encumbrance limits to barbarians of level 6 or higher that have the Aspect of the Beast: Bear listed in their features.  The 'Bear' designation can be separated from the main feature with a dash or colon (i.e. - or :).  Any amount of white space is also fine as it's matched via a flexible regular expression.

Future Enhancements:
- Have the barbarian class and level filtering be an option instead of always enabled, defaulting to enabled.

Changelist:
- v1.0 - Initial version.
- v1.1 - Improvements to conform to FGU and upcoming standards. Improvements in code structure.  Matching/regex improvements for flexibility and reliability.  Function renaming for clarity.
